First ever python GUI lets gooooo!!

    I used quite a few tutorials / youtube videos / websties listed in this readme further down :)
    I'm pretty new to coding too, so I'm sure I'll be so happy with how this turns out.

All the graphics, sprites, music and fonts were made by hand by me from my school issued laptop.
 (sorry if they are shabby)
 These are the applications I used:
 - MS paint online (creating backgrounds / blocky images)
 - Adobe photoshop (mostly for resizing my png images)
 - Piskel (for my sprites)
 - BeepBox (for creating sfx / soundtracks)

 All of these I used for free, they are easily accessible and work really well !!
 
I also coded this using the pygame library !
Here's a link to their website, where you can also find their github:
    https://www.pygame.org/news

here's the information on all my helpful tutorials :):)
    (big shoutout to these guys)

 - Baraltech (YouTube) 
 This guy does extremely helpful video tutorials on how to use pygame's library
 Also props to him for the button and font tutorial, used one of his videos for the main menu screen as well.

 This website was super duper helpful, anything you can use in the pygame library this website will teach you how to use. I specifically used it for the tutorial on importing and playing mp3s, so my game could have a cute lil soundtrack / sfx.
